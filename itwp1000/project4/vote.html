            <br>
            <p>Here are photos nominated for the final vote that we still need your help in determining the winners. If
                you submitted a photo for the month and don't see it here, don't worry we receive several submissions
                and may not have processed yours for this month so please check in the following month after your
                submission to see if yours has been posted. Please only place one vote per person. If you are caught
                submitting multiple votes your votes will be revoked and further submissions will be void. You may place
                a vote for each category and are encouraged to do so.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Let us know if there's another approach you'd like to see us take to the voting process. We're are always
                looking for ways to improve our site and are open to feedback. Please make sure to fill out all require
                fields before submitting your vote. Once the email opens to finish the submission process please leave
                any words directly before or after the equal sign that are already preloaded within the document as this
                is how we determine the votes. Check in each month to vote for new winners! Good luck to all and
                remember fortune favors the brave.</p>
