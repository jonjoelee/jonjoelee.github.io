            <h2>Categories</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The categories are Cityscapes, Nature Shots, and Food..</p>
            <br>
            <p>Cityscapes could be the entire skyline of a city or it could be a single building. A cityscape could also
                be a barrage of factories or people traveling a common path in the city. Any of the physical traits of
                the city could be considered part of the cityscape. Although not exclusively synonymous townscapes will
                be accepted too, meaning if it's not a conventional city and is a town instead that is okay. It cannot
                be a lone building in a rural area, this could fall under the nature category though.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Nature shots is probably the broadest category as it could be just nature it's self or one of the many
                specific facets of it. Examples would be a close up of a blade of grass or a water droplet, a flock of
                geese or a heard of deer, an abandoned building being reclaimed by nature or a house being completely
                surrounded by nature with the emphasis on the surrounding nature. Essentially as long as the focus is on
                nature it's self and not some other portion of the photograph there shouldn't be any issues.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Food is a pretty straight forward category but I'll still clarify what is acceptable to ease any
                potential confusion. For this category here are some examples that would be good, ingredients on a
                cutting board, food being harvested, food growing on the vine or stalk, a beautifully prepared dish, or
                anything else remotely related to food. No graphic images.</p>
