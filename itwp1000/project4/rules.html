            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The rules are as follows and there is to be no exceptions. For all image files submitted they MUST be one
                of the following formats: gif, jpg, or png. Any inappropriate content will not only have no chance of
                being shown but also users who do so will not be considered for any of their future gallery submissions.
                Any photo submitted that does not pertain specifically to one of the three categories will automatically
                be disqualified from the contest gallery display. If you're worried whether or not it would fit into a
                category, it probably does. Sketches and other forms of art are acceptable as long as they are directly
                related to a given category. Images that are animated or move will also not be accepted.</p>
            <br>
            <p>All photos posted to this page are original works of art. Any photographs submitted must be owned
                entirely by the user. Any submission made on the last day of the month will be considered for the
                following months contest, as it can take up to a day for our team to process and post submitted
                pictures.
                Again, if any rules are broken, the user will not be considered for any future contests and may possibly
                be banned from having their photos considered for the gallery. If you have any questions or concerns
                please reach out via the email link at the bottom of this page. Thanks for visiting and have a lovely
                day!</p>
