    <h2>Tangled Up In Blue</h2>
    <i><b>By Bob Dylan</b></i>
    <br>
    <p><a id="v1"></a>
        Early one morning the sun was shining<br>
        I was laying in bed<br>
        Wondering if she'd changed at all<br>
        If her hair was still red<br>
        Her folks they said our lives together<br>
        Sure was gonna be rough<br>
        They never did like mama's homemade dress<br>
        Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough<br>
        And I was standing on the side of the road<br>
        Rain falling on my shoes<br>
        Heading out for the East Coast<br>
        Lord knows I've paid some dues<br>
        Getting through<br>
        Tangled up in blue.
    </p>
    <p><a id="v2"></a>
        She was married when we first met<br>
        Soon to be divorced<br>
        I helped her out of a jam I guess<br>
        But I used a little too much force<br>
        We drove that car as far as we could<br>
        Abandoned it out West<br>
        Split up on a dark sad night<br>
        Both agreeing it was best<br>
        She turned around to look at me<br>
        As I was walking away<br>
        I heard her say over my shoulder<br>
        "We'll meet again someday<br>
        on the avenue"<br>
        Tangled up in blue.

    </p>
    <p><a id="v3"></a>
        I had a job in the great north woods<br>
        Working as a cook for a spell<br>
        But I never did like it all that much<br>
        And one day the ax just fell<br>
        So I drifted down to New Orleans<br>
        so I lucky was to be employed<br>
        Working for a while on a fishing boat<br>
        Right outside of Delacroix<br>
        But all the while I was alone<br>
        The past was close behind<br>
        I seen a lot of women<br>
        But she never escaped my mind<br>
        And I just grew<br>
        Tangled up in blue.
    </p>
    <p><a id="v4"></a>
        She was working in a topless place<br>
        And I stopped in for a beer<br>
        I just kept looking at the side of her face<br>
        In the spotlight so clear<br>
        And later on when the crowd thinned out<br>
        I was just about to do the same<br>
        She was standing there in back of my chair<br>
        Said to me, "Don't I know your name?"<br>
        I muttered something underneath my breath<br>
        She studied the lines on my face<br>
        I must admit I felt a little uneasy<br>
        When she bent down to tie the laces<br>
        Of my shoe<br>
        Tangled up in blue.
    </p>
    <p><a id="v5"></a>
        She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe<br>
        "I thought you'd never say hello," she said,<br>
        "You look like the silent type."<br>
        Then she opened up a book of poems<br>
        And handed it to me<br>
        Written by an Italian poet<br>
        From the thirteenth century<br>
        And every one of them words rang true<br>
        And glowed like burning coal<br>
        Pouring off of every page<br>
        Like it was written in my soul<br>
        From me to you<br>
        Tangled up in blue
    </p>
    <p><a id="v6"></a>
        I lived with them on Montague street<br>
        In a basement down the stairs<br>
        There was music in the caf√©s at night<br>
        And revolution in the air<br>
        Then he started into dealing with slaves<br>
        And something inside of him died<br>
        She had to sell everything she owned<br>
        And froze up inside<br>
        And when it finally the bottom fell out<br>
        I became withdrawn<br>
        The only thing I knew how to do<br>
        Was to keep on keeping on<br>
        Like a bird that flew<br>
        Tangled up in blue.<br>
    </p>
    <p><a id="v7"></a>
        So now I'm going back again<br>
        I got to get to her somehow<br>
        All the people we used to know<br>
        They're an illusion to me now<br>
        Some are mathematicians<br>
        Some are carpenter's wives<br>
        Don't know how it all got started<br>
        I don't know what they do with their lives<br>
        But me I'm still on the road<br>
        A-heading for another joint<br>
        We always did feel the same<br>
        We just saw it from a different point<br>
        Of view<br>
        Tangled up in blue.
