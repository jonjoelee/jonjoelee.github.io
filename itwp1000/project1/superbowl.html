        <p>The Super Bowl is the Championship game for the entire NFL that’s been played for 55 years and this year will
            mark the 56th. Each year the winning team is awarded a new Vince Lombardi Trophy, which you can see in the
            picture above. Each winner, staff & players included, are given a ring that is estimated at $36,000. The
            Winning team
            also receives a total of about $200,000 bonus. $29,000 is awarded for the Divisional playoff, $54,000 for
            the
            Conference playoff, and $118,000 for the Super Bowl victory itself.

            No Team has ever won the super bowl more than 6 times, that being the New England Patriots
            and the Pittsburgh Steelers. Right behind those teams the San Francisco 49ers and the Dallas Cowboys have 5
            Super Bowl victories. Amazingly enough there is one player with more Super Bowl wins than any team, U of M
            Graduate, weighing in at 7 Super Bowl Wins, Tom Brady (#12).</p>
