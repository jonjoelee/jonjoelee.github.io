        <p>The NFL playoffs determine who competes in the Super Bowl but how are the playoff determined? That’s exactly
            what we’ll be discussing here. First, we need to know that there are 32 teams in the entire league, 16 of
            which are in the AFC and the other 16 in the NFC. At the end of the season the teams in the AFC compete for
            the AFC championship and the NFC their own championship as well. The Super Bowl is then a matchup of the AFC
            & NFC champions. </p>

        <p>Okay, cool but how are teams picked for the playoffs? Glad you asked, The NFC & AFC are both comprised of 4
            divisions, north east south west. In each division there is 4 teams bringing the total to 16 teams in each
            conference. From the four teams in each division, the team with the best W-L record in each, will have a
            guaranteed seed in the playoffs, the team with the best overall record in the conference will receive a bye
            the first week of the playoffs also know as the wild card round. That’s 4 of the teams in the playoffs but
            what about the other 3, well the 3 runner up teams in the conference with the best record (W-L) will also
            receive a seed in the playoffs. This means 7 teams from each conference which is 14 for the league. </p>
