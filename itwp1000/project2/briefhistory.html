            The NFL was established in 1920. Originally the season champion was the team with the best win loss record
            usually shown 12-4 or 15-1 with the wins in the front and the losses in the back. In 1933 a playoff system
            replaced the old method for picking a season champion. 34 years later in 1967 the NFL merged with the AFL
            (American football league) thus began the tradition of the Super bowl. 2 divisions and only 1 league
            champion.

            Since 1970 a new trophy is issued each year for the winner of that season to keep. The trophy was named the
            Vince Lombardi Trophy after a head coach who led the Green Bay Packers to victories in the first two Super
            bowls. The trophies are produced by Tiffany & Co. and made from sterling silver It’s also said that the
            trophy’s worth ranges between $25,000-$300,000. The winner of each conference also receives a trophy. For
            the AFC, American Football Conference, the trophy is the Lamar Hunt Trophy and the NFC, National Football
            Conference, the George Salas Trophy.
