        <p>The Super Bowl is the Championship game for the entire NFL thatâ€™s been played for 55 years and this year will
            mark the 56th. Each year the winning team is awarded a new Vince Lombardi Trophy, which you can see in the
            picture above. Each winner, staff & players included, are given a ring that is estimated at $36,000. The
            Winning team
            also receives a total of about $200,000 bonus. $29,000 is awarded for the Divisional playoff, $54,000 for
            the
            Conference playoff, and $118,000 for the Super Bowl victory itself.

            No Team has ever won the super bowl more than 6 times, that being the New England Patriots
            and the Pittsburgh Steelers. Right behind those teams the San Francisco 49ers and the Dallas Cowboys have 5
            Super Bowl victories. Amazingly enough there is one player with more Super Bowl wins than any team, U of M
            Graduate, weighing in at 7 Super Bowl Wins, Tom Brady (#12).</p>
