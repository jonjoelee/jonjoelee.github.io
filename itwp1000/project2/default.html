        <h2>How The Game Is Played</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Each game takes place on a 100-yard field with 2 teams each comprised of 53 players, 46 of which allowed
            to
            suit up for game day. Each team is broken into 3 parts their offense, defense, and special teams. Each
            team
            is allowed 11 players on the field totaling for 22 players. Each game is broken up into 4 fifteen-minute
            quarters and a twelve-minute half time after the second quarter. The team with the most points at the
            end of
            the 4th quarter is declared the winner.</p>
        <hr>

            The Goal of the game is to move the ball into the opposing teams endzone to score what’s called a
            touchdown
            for 6 points and a chance at an extra point for a total of 7 points. The team that starts with the ball
            tries to move down the field in a series of plays also known as downs. This happens two ways, the
            quarterback will either throw the ball down the field to a wide receiver or a running back will be
            handed
            the ball and try to rush down the field. The offense, the team with the ball, must move the ball 10
            yards
            every 4 downs(plays) to keep the ball in their possession. Again, the end goal being to get the ball
            down
            the field and score a touchdown
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The defense’s goal is to keep the offense from getting 10 yards in 4 downs and if they succeed the
            offense
            has two choices to kick the ball back to the other team or if they’re close to the opponents endzone to
            kick
            the ball between the goal posts for 3 points also called a field goal. If the defense can make the
            offense
            drop the ball or catch it then that team’s offense is given the ball where the defensive player was
            declared
            down.
